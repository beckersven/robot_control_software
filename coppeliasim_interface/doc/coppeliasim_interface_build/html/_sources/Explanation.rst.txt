This package is the nexus between ROS and CoppeliaSim. The :ref:`simulation-synchronizer` ensures that the time in ROS (available through '/clock'-topic) increases with the same rate as in CoppeliaSim.
This is crucial for timed tasks, like simulated real-time-control. This module also calls specified services at each simulation-step.
The :ref:`hardware-interface` mimics a real ros_control-interface but instead of controlling actual motors, the controller output is forwarded to the joints in CoppeliaSim's UR10e and
the simulated joint-values are used as feedback for the controllers. This package was designed similarly to the drivers of the real UR-robots, which means that it works
on the one hand seemlessly with every framework developed for use with real robots (like MoveIt) and on the other hand that movements evaluated in a simulation
can be identically performed in reality when the real driver is loaded instead - No remapping of ROS-topics etc. is required!
The third component, :ref:`point-cloud-manager` , makes the Point-Cloud measured by the scanner in CoppeliaSim accessible tothe ROS-system by transforming it. It also allows 
stitching of the measured Point-Cloud as well the application of an uncertainty-model to immeadiately review the measurement.
